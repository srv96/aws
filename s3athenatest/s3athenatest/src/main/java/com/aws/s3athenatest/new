Hello Team,

My name is Sourav Dash, and I am thrilled to be joining the AlaS Zeta LTP team as a Senior Data Engineer. For the past couple of years, I have worked as a Data Engineer at an investment bank, and I am very excited about this new role and opportunity.

When I am not at work, I love playing badminton, working out at the gym, hiking, bike riding, and spending time with friends. When I am alone, I enjoy watching YouTube; my go-to channels are 3Blue1Brown, Think School, and Chef Ranveer Brar.

I look forward to meeting all of you and contributing to our team's success.
