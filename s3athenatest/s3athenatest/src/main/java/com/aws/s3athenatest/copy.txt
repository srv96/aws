Certainly! Here's an example of a README file for a common library component that serves functionality for Athena, Amazon S3, Secrets Manager, and PostgreSQL:

Common Library Component
The Common Library Component is a Java library that provides functionality for working with Athena, Amazon S3, Secrets Manager, and PostgreSQL. It offers convenient methods and utilities to interact with these services, making it easier to integrate them into your Java applications.

Features
Query execution and result retrieval from Athena.
File upload, download, and management in Amazon S3.
Secrets retrieval and management from Secrets Manager.
Database connection and query execution with PostgreSQL.
Installation
To use the Common Library Component in your Java project, you can follow these steps:

Download the latest release JAR file from the releases page.
Add the JAR file to your project's dependencies or build path.
Import the necessary classes in your Java code.
Usage
Below are some examples of how to use the Common Library Component for different functionalities:

Athena
java
Copy code
import com.example.commonlib.AthenaClient;

// Create an instance of Athena client
AthenaClient athenaClient = new AthenaClient();

// Execute a query and retrieve the results
String query = "SELECT * FROM mytable";
List<Map<String, Object>> results = athenaClient.executeQuery(query);

// Process the query results
for (Map<String, Object> row : results) {
    // Access column values by column name
    String columnName = "column_name";
    Object columnValue = row.get(columnName);
    // ...
}
Amazon S3
java
Copy code
import com.example.commonlib.S3Client;

// Create an instance of S3 client
S3Client s3Client = new S3Client();

// Upload a file to S3
String bucketName = "my-bucket";
String key = "path/to/myfile.txt";
File file = new File("path/to/local/file.txt");
s3Client.uploadFile(bucketName, key, file);

// Download a file from S3
File downloadedFile = s3Client.downloadFile(bucketName, key, "path/to/local/downloaded-file.txt");

// Delete a file from S3
s3Client.deleteFile(bucketName, key);
Secrets Manager
java
Copy code
import com.example.commonlib.SecretsManagerClient;

// Create an instance of Secrets Manager client
SecretsManagerClient secretsManagerClient = new SecretsManagerClient();

// Retrieve a secret value by secret name
String secretName = "my-secret";
String secretValue = secretsManagerClient.getSecretValue(secretName);
PostgreSQL
java
Copy code
import com.example.commonlib.PostgreSQLClient;

// Create an instance of PostgreSQL client
PostgreSQLClient postgreSQLClient = new PostgreSQLClient();

// Connect to the PostgreSQL database
String connectionString = "jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/mydatabase";
String username = "myuser";
String password = "mypassword";
postgreSQLClient.connect(connectionString, username, password);

// Execute a query
String query = "SELECT * FROM mytable";
List<Map<String, Object>> results = postgreSQLClient.executeQuery(query);

// Process the query results
for (Map<String, Object> row : results) {
    // Access column values by column name
    String columnName = "column_name";
    Object columnValue = row.get(columnName);
    // ...
}

// Disconnect from the PostgreSQL database
postgreSQLClient.disconnect();
Please refer to the library's documentation for more detailed information on available methods and configurations.
