Modular vs Monolithic Approach


User
if i am making a component in java whcih have 5 sub component then which is better 
1. making all the config in one place, service in place and model in one place
2. making 5 folder and make config service model folder in each .

When designing a component in Java with five sub-components, the best approach depends on the specific requirements and complexity of your project. However, here are two common strategies:

Monolithic Approach:
In this approach, you can organize your code into packages or modules based on functionality rather than creating separate folders for each sub-component. You can have a single configuration package, service package, and model package within your component.
Advantages:

Simplicity: Having everything in one place can make it easier to navigate and understand the overall structure of your component.
Code reusability: Components can easily access and share common resources.
Disadvantages:

Increased complexity: As the component grows, it may become more challenging to manage and maintain.
Potential for code duplication: Without clear separation, it may be more difficult to identify and eliminate duplicated code.
Modular Approach:
In this approach, you create separate folders for each sub-component, such as config, service, and model.
Advantages:

Modularity: Each sub-component is organized and contained within its own folder, making it easier to manage and maintain.
Code isolation: Changes made to one sub-component are less likely to impact others, promoting better code encapsulation.
Disadvantages:

Increased overhead: With more folders and files, there may be a slight increase in complexity and overhead for navigating between different sub-components.
Potential redundancy: If there are common resources required by multiple sub-components, you need to manage them appropriately to avoid code duplication.
Overall, both approaches have their merits, and the choice depends on the specific needs and complexity of your project. If the component is relatively small and the sub-components are closely related, the monolithic approach might provide simplicity and code reusability. However, if the sub-components are distinct and likely to evolve independently, the modular approach can offer better code organization and maintainability.
