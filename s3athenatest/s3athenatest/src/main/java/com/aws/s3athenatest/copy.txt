Subject: Farewell and New Beginnings

Dear Team,

I hope this message finds you well.

Today marks my last working day with [Current Company]. As I prepare to embark on a new journey with [New Organization], I wanted to take a moment to express my heartfelt gratitude to each one of you.

It has been a privilege to work alongside such a talented and dedicated group of professionals. The experiences and memories we've shared have profoundly impacted me, both personally and professionally. I am excited about the opportunities that lie ahead, but I will undoubtedly miss the camaraderie, support, and collaborative spirit that define our team.

I am confident that our paths will cross again in the future. Until then, I wish you all continued success and growth. Please stay in touch; my personal email is [Your Personal Email].

Thank you for everything.

Warm regards,

[Your Full Name]
